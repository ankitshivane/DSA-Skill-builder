* n every problem, constraints are your guidelines.you can't ignore them, and they guide how you approach the problem.
* Why Constraints Matter
  Constraints are there to:
  * Narrow down the possible solutions. 
  * Give you clues about which algorithm will work best. 
  * Indicate efficiency limits: Can your algorithm be slow or must it be lightning fast?
* Step 9: Beginner rule you MUST remember 
  * If values are small → array 
  * If values are huge → HashSet / HashMap 
  * If n is large → single loop
  * 1️⃣ Read constraints FIRST 
  * 2️⃣ Large n → avoid nested loops
  * 3️⃣ Huge + negative values → no index-based array 
  * 4️⃣ Use HashSet for duplicate detection 
  * 5️⃣ Constraints → solution, not decoration
